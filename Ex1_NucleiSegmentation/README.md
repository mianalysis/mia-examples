Example 1: Segmentation of nuclei in 3D from confocal stacks
---------------------------------

In this example we'll segment nuclei in 3D from a confocal image stack and measure some basic shape properties.

This example introduces the following concepts:
- Loading images into the MIA
- Performing basic image processing steps
- Segmentation of objects from binarised images
- Measuring detected objects and filtering based on these measurements
- Visualising detected objects with overlays
- Exporting object measurements to spreadsheet
