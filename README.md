MIA workflow examples
------------
Example workflows for the modular image and object analysis Fiji plugin, [MIA](https://github.com/mianalysis/mia). 

These workflows introduce various processes of MIA such as image loading, object segmentation, object measurements, object relationships and visualisation. Each example contains the necessary files to get it running: the example workflow, any raw images required and any example outputs that are generated by the workflow.

For the full MIA documentation, please go to [mianalysis.github.io](https://mianalysis.github.io)


Usage
------------
Each module in these workflows includes a corresponding set of notes summarising the purpose of that module and its configuration. These notes can be viewed by enabling the "Notes" panel ("View > Show notes panel" from the MIA menu) and selecting a module from the list of modules in "editing view".

While these workflows correspond to a specific analysis, the principles covered (i.e. image loading, processing, object detection and measurements) are applicable to most workflows.

Note: Any object outlines in the generated "overlay" images will typically only be visible when opened in ImageJ/Fiji.


Note
------------
Example workflows are constantly being added.  If you have any questions, please contact stephen.cross@bristol.ac.uk.
