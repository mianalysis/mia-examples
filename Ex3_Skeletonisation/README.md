Example 2: Segmentation of DNA and "protein" peaks from AFM images
---------------------------------

In this example we'll use MIA's integration with the [Ridge Detection]() Fiji plugin to detect DNA from AFM images.  Following this, we'll detect "protein" peaks and count the number per DNA molecule.  Note: In this example, the DNA images are real, but the protein peaks are synthetic.

This example introduces the following concepts:
- Use of dedicated ridge and spot detection modules
- Relating two different object sets
